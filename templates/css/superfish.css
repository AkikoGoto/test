/* This first group of styles are most important for the function of Superfish.
 * The more cosmetic styling rules are grouped together below under the heading
 * ORIGINAL SKIN.
 *
 * Note that this CSS file will create the kind of menu demonstrated on the main
 * page of the Superfish documentation, ie. top tier of nav is horizontal, with
 * subsequent tiers vertical.

/**** Position of further tiers of nav ****/
/* To add further tiers, you need copy the previous block of code (everything back until the "Position of fourth tier of nav" comment) and paste it in here. Then add an extra li just after .nav in each of the pasted selectors. So the new block will differ from the copied block in the same way that the block for the fourth tier differs from the block for the third tier.*/


/**** Very important ****/
/* this negates the pure CSS hovers so submenu remains hidden and JS controls when and how it appears. This is in turn is overridden by the .sfHover rules above as they have greater specificity */
/* notice there are three selectors here. You need three for a four tier menu system. If you had a five tier system you would copy the last selector of these three and paste it below to create a fourth selector and add another li just after the .superfish part. On the other hand if you only had a three tiered menu you could delete the third line here and save some file size.*/

/******************** ORIGINAL SKIN ******************/
/*
 * The CSS below is my attempt to extract most of the stuff you need to change in order
 * to reskin the menu with the appearance you require. However, certain rules above
 * (indicated with the word "VARIABLE") may also need to be altered to suit the width
 * and height of your menu items and submenus. For example, if you need wider submenus
 * eg: .nav ul { width:12em} then you will need to also apply that value
 * to the left offset of any deeper nested submenus, eg:
 * .nav li li:hover ul,
 * ul.nav li li.sfHover ul {
	 left:12em; top:-1px;
   }
 *
 * Other than that, most of the cosmetic stuff is below:
